# Heart-Disease-Prediction
The Heart Disease Prediction Project used machine learning to develop a classification model predicting heart disease likelihood. Data was cleaned and features engineered, with an optimized model achieving 85% accuracy. This project aids early detection, enabling healthcare providers to take proactive measures and improve patient outcomes.
In the Heart Disease Prediction Project, I evaluated multiple machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, by comparing their Silhouette Scores to determine the most suitable model. The dataset included patient details such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other vital health metrics.

I performed thorough data preprocessing, handling missing values, scaling features, and selecting the most relevant variables for the model. After testing various algorithms, I selected the best-performing one based on its Silhouette Score and overall accuracy, which achieved 85% prediction accuracy.

This process ensured that the model was both robust and efficient, providing accurate heart disease predictions. By focusing on key health parameters, this project demonstrates how machine learning can aid in early detection and improve decision-making in healthcare, ultimately allowing healthcare providers to proactively address potential risks and improve patient outcomes.
